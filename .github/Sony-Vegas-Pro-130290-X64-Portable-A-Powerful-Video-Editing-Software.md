You can use scripts to create custom commands, menus, buttons, and keyboard shortcuts. You can also use scripts to control external devices, such as cameras, recorders, and switchers[^1^].
- **HDR color grading and scopes:** This feature allows you to work with high dynamic range (HDR) video, which has a wider range of colors and brightness than standard dynamic range (SDR) video. You can use color grading tools, such as color wheels, curves, and LUTs, to adjust the tone and mood of your HDR video. You can also use scopes, such as waveform, vectorscope, and histogram, to monitor the color and exposure of your HDR video[^1^].
- **Planar motion tracking:** This feature allows you to track the motion of a specific object or area in your video, such as a face, a logo, or a sign.

- **Optical-flow slow motion:** This feature allows you to create smooth and realistic slow motion effects from your video clips. Optical-flow slow motion analyzes the motion between frames and creates new frames to fill in the gaps. This results in smoother and more natural-looking slow motion than traditional frame blending methods[^1^].
- **Video stabilization:** This feature allows you to reduce camera shake and jitter from your handheld or action camera footage. Video stabilization analyzes the motion in your video and applies corrections to make it smoother and steadier. You can adjust the amount and type of stabilization to suit your needs[^1^].
